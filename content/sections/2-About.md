Philly and Toronto was close enough for them to visit each other once every month, but no matter how much joy they felt during the hellos, their hearts became heavier and heavier with each goodbyes…",

They hopped on a helicopter ride around Toronto downtown core. The experience was overwhelming enough for Vy, who had never been on a helicopter. Once the ride is over, Vy’s soul, which hadn’t even reached the ground, got lifted up again when Huan kneel down and popped the ultimate question. YES.",

        "Vy and Huan always wanted to have a puppy in their life, but their distance prevented them from ever thinking of actually adopting one. Sensing that it was the right moment, Huan decided to one day ask Vy if she want him to adopt a puppy. That same evening, the adorable malshi pup, later came to be known as Soju joined their family. Vy immediately hopped on a bus ride to Toronto the following day to see her new “son”. The morning after, it was love at first sight for both of them. Adopted by Huan, but Soju had never been able to be away from Vy since that day.
        To Soju, we love you more than you will ever know. If there is another life, we wish that you will be our son by birth and that we will get a chance to raise you and give you the best life that you deserve to have. You are our little ray of sunshine amidst the worldly chaos that ensue since 2020. Thank you for entering our life and giving us the privilege of raising you into your adorable self that we love so dearly.

      content: "As COVID was raging on all over North America, Huan rushed over to Philly to pick Vy up as he feared that the border between the two countries might be closed. After a last minute scare that the border might be closed while they’re still in the US, they rushed back to Canada in the night and made it back to Toronto just in time. “How long will you remain in Canada?” – asked the border agent. “Two weeks” – said Vy. Little did she know, that two weeks was actually two years, enough time for her to call Toronto home and establish a life together with Huan and Soju. At last, the average distance between them is reduced to within arms reach.",
